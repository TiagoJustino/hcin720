# hcin720 - Assignment 3

This assignment illustrates how to use a laser cutter a 3D printer enclosures
for a micro controller project. Moreover, it demonstrate how the final product
  can interact with everyday objects.

## Step 1 - Soldering

The first step towards a more polished product is getting rid of the
breadboard. The battery shield and the accelerometer were soldered together.
Also, female and male connectors were added to the battery shield pins and to
the sensors and actuators as necessary. Finally a on/off switch was added to
the battery:

## Step 2 - Cardboard enclosure

A cardboard enclosure was created using the laser cutter. The box was designed
using a 2D design software (Adobe Illustrator) and the cardboard was cut using
a [universal laser systems vls
6.60](http://www.engravingsys.com/flying-optics-laser/vls-platform-laser/vls-6-60-platform/).
