# hcin720 - Assignment 1

This assinment presents (in three different ways) data fetched from github
regarding events (e.g. push, pull request) happening now.

## Data Source

Github was used as data source. It provides a url that returns all events
happening on github right now in JSON format
([https://api.github.com/events](https://api.github.com/events)).

## Libraries

Only two libraries were used in this project:

* [jQuery]( https://jquery.com/)
* [Paper.js](http://paperjs.org/)

All visualizations were done (almost) from scratch using only these two libraries.

## Visualizations

Three visualizations were created for the fetched data. The [Basic
Visualisations](https://rawgit.com/TiagoJustino/hcin720/master/assignment01.2/index.html)
show part of the cumulative data fetched, both as a list and a cumulative
graph. The
[Animation](https://rawgit.com/TiagoJustino/hcin720/master/assignment01.2/animation.html)
shows what is happaning on Github now in a fun way.
